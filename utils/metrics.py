    """
    Calculate KPIs and performance metrics from the solution and input data.
    KPIs:
    - total_procurement_cost: Sum of all procurement quantities Ã— unit cost (across all products, suppliers, periods)
    - service_level: Total supplied / total demand (should be 1.0 if all demand is met)
    - inventory_turnover: Total demand / average inventory (higher = more efficient use of stock)
    - obsolescence: Inventory left after 4+ periods (risk of waste; should be low)
    Step-by-step:
    1. Aggregate procurement cost and total supplied from the procurement plan.
    2. Calculate total demand from the demand data.
    3. Compute service level as total supplied / total demand.
    4. Compute average inventory and inventory turnover.
    5. Compute obsolescence as inventory left after 4+ periods.
    Returns a dictionary of KPI names and values.
